# hello.box

hello.box is a work in progress, a fork of [dphiffer's](https://github.com/dphiffer) [Occupy.here](http://occupyhere.org/) to create a portable, personal backchannel.

## Aims of the project

- Expect first-time/one-time users and optimise the interface for them.
- Simplify the chat interface (removing uploads and other interactions - pure chat stream).
- Expand the admin/owner's presence: allow them to host content they wish to share.
